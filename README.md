# Student-Attendance-System
The Student Attendance System is a modern, user-friendly web application built using ReactJS. It allows teachers or staff to mark, view, and export student attendance records efficiently without the need for paper-based tracking.

This is a frontend-only project, meaning it does not require a backend server or database. All attendance is handled directly in the browser and can be exported for reporting purposes.
